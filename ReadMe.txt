The files in this folder should be enough to replicate the CSSWE Geant analysis.  

A brief overview:

- REPTILE07 is the Geant simulation.
- /src is the source code for the simulation - you can change the instrument geometry in src/DetectorConstruction.cc
- I'm not sure if /include, /CLHEP, and GNUmakefile are needed, or if they're generated by Geant for each run.  I'm including them anyway.
- I visualize the simulation in HepRApp.  But I'm not sure what's needed for you to get it on your system.  I naively included HepRApp.jar, hoping that this .jar is all you need for the visualization.  
- GeantSetupScript simply runs three commands that are necessary prior to a Geant run
- vis1.mac specifies particle energies and beam direction for the run
- VisualizeVis1REPTILE is run as a top-level script, which calls all of the above scripts to run Geant.
